## üí° Overview  

**Soulver** is a unique hybrid between a **text editor and a calculator**, designed for quick calculations, everyday problem-solving, and note-based math. It‚Äôs an intelligent workspace that lets you write out problems naturally‚Äîusing words, numbers, and variables‚Äîwhile Soulver instantly computes results in real time.  

Unlike traditional calculators, Soulver lets you **think in sentences** rather than button sequences. You can perform multi-line calculations, assign values to variables, reference previous lines, and even use natural language expressions. The result is a remarkably intuitive way to handle numbers, making it ideal for freelancers, students, analysts, and anyone who works with figures regularly.  

**Soulver 3**, the latest version, brings a beautifully redesigned interface optimized for macOS and iOS, along with extended functionality such as **smart currency conversion**, **time zone math**, **percentage breakdowns**, and **automatic variable detection**. The app supports both light and dark modes and offers seamless synchronization through iCloud, so your calculations are always available across all Apple devices.  

Beyond its practicality, Soulver encourages creative thinking with numbers. It‚Äôs the perfect blend of clarity and efficiency‚Äîallowing users to plan budgets, estimate projects, or perform quick calculations without opening a spreadsheet.  

With its elegant balance of **simplicity and depth**, Soulver transforms how users interact with math, turning calculations into something almost conversational.
